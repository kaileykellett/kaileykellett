- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kaileykellett
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a computer science student at the University of Manitoba!
- ðŸŒ± Much of this page contains projects I made over the course of my high school education, usually in Visual Studio for Windows using Winforms.
  - This means most of the code contained here is best run using the same IDE, or some other software which can handle Winforms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Email kellettk@myumanitoba.ca or kaileykellett@gmail.com
